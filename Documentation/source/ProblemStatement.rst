PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================

Although the last prototype of pressure measuring system works, it needs improvements. To star with the system is in a prototype stage, and it had areas that could be improved to achieve a final product stage. The measurements were not reliable nor repeatable. The reproduction of the system was also problematic due to the lack of documentation. Two technical improvements for the project were required, the capacity to read up to 8 sensors and an increase in the resolution of the samples.
