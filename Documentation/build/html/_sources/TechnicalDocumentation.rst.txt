SENSOR TEKSCAN A201
-------------------
This pressure sensor works like a variable resistor, in which the resistances changes depending on the force. When the sensor has no pressure, it has its highest resistance, and as pressure increases resistance decreases. The change in resistance is not linear, but the conductance is, to take benefit of this characteristic opamp configurations are implemented to have a linear output.
