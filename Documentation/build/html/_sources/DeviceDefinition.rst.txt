DEVICE DEFINITION
=================
To define the technical requirements from the system the context of use of the device is analyzed. The sensor system would be used in tests where the sensors are placed on the stump of the subject and then will be invited to walk on a treadmill. The subject of the test should have freedom of movement, so a wireless communication will be preferred. For an operator would be practical to have access to the information fast and easily, make an initial hypothesis based on the data provided by the system, to verify that the test is correct and make any correction on the sensorâ€™s installation if needed. Due to the natural tendency of the sensors to de-calibrate, the system should have a way to test the calibration of the system and possibility to calibrate it.
